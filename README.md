# Breadgoat Woocommerce Takealot Store Sync 
 Woocommerce Takealot Store Sync allows you to seamlessly integrate your Takealot seller account with your WooCommerce store. Fetch all your products from Takealot, including primary product images, stock on hand, titles, pricing, and SKU, and sync them to your WooCommerce site.
