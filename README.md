# Breadgoat Woocommerce Takealot Store Sync 
 Woocommerce Takealot Store Sync allows you to seamlessly integrate your Takealot seller account with your WooCommerce store. Fetch all your products from Takealot, including primary product images, stock on hand, titles, pricing, and SKU, and sync them to your WooCommerce site. The SKU is used as a unique identifier to ensure accuracy across platforms. If you have existing products in your WooCommerce store, this plugin will update that information based on your Takealot store data.
