Synchronize your WooCommerce store with your Takealot seller account, including products, images, stock, and more.

== Description ==

Woocommerce Takealot Store Sync allows you to seamlessly integrate your Takealot seller account with your WooCommerce store. Fetch all your products from Takealot, including primary product images, stock on hand, titles, pricing, and SKU, and sync them to your WooCommerce site. The SKU is used as a unique identifier to ensure accuracy across platforms. If you have existing products in your WooCommerce store, this plugin will update that information based on your Takealot store data.

**Features:**
- **Product Sync**: Automatically import and update product listings from Takealot to WooCommerce.
- **Image Sync**: Download and set primary product images.
- **Stock Management**: Keep your WooCommerce stock levels in sync with your Takealot store.
- **Price Sync**: Ensure your product pricing is consistent across both platforms.
- **SKU Matching**: Use SKU as a unique identifier for syncing products accurately.
